### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy working on fun projects and solving puzzles. I use this account purely for personal use and not for professional work.

Current projects:
- ðŸŽ… [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) [My Solutions](https://github.com/BigBear0812/AdventOfCode) I'm completing Advent of Code using Node JS without outside libraries beyond what is in the base Node Framework. I'm also leaving detailed comments to better explain my thinking and solution for each day.
